Throughout my undergraduate, I have been a part of various Projects and Workshops under Professors, student run clubs, and programmes.
##Projects
###Non-Linear Cosmic Structure Formation *with Prof Matthias Bartelmann, Heidelberg University*

Matthias's group is involved with Kinetic Field Theory, an analytic field theory of structure formation in classical particle ensembles and its applications in probing the origin of cosmic structures. Personally, I applied the formalism of KFT to original calculations of the non-linear cosmic power spectrum for a variety of modified gravity models incorporating screening mechanisms such as the Chameleon model, Vainshtein screening, k-mouflage mechanism and Yukawa suppression. I implemented these changes in code as well, generalizing it to include parametrizations of modified gravity models into a scale dependent effective gravitational constant to successfully plot the non-linear spectra for a variety of models. Currently, we are working on using a taylor approximation to obtaine in the non-linear spectra for midfied gravity models, as expanding it around the calcuated GR one.
