## PT Symmetric Photonic Heterostructures
*with Prof Anshuman Kumar, IITB*

I studied a generalization of hermitian hamiltonian's, specifically PT symmetric Hamiltonian's in optics, and the resulting S matrices, transfer Matrices, and the generalized unitarity relations specifying the conservation relations between transmittance and left/right reflectances. I then reproduced plots of trivial and non trivial Anisotropic Transmission Resonances using Abeles Matrix Formalism, PT symmetry breaking transitions, phase transition boundaries, and uniqueness of the scattering matrix using python, and studied the application of such heterostructures in CPA laser points, unidirectional invisibility, and others.
