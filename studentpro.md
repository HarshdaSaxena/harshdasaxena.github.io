##  Cosmology and Dark Matter
*Summer of Science, Maths and Physics Club*
Studied special relativity, with emphasis on its tensorial analysis, the mathematical foundations of general relativity, Einstein tensors, Bianchi identities and the field equations from A First Course in General Relativity by Bernard Schutz. Studied applications of general relativity such as the production and detection of gravitational waves, Schwarzschild and Kerr Blackholes and the metric around relativistic stars. Studied the basics of Modern Cosmology from Scott Dodelson, specifically on Nucleosynthesis and Boltzmann Equations.
