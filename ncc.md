NCC stands for National Cadet Corps, a voluntary organization, the youth wing of the Indian Armed Forces. I completed a year-long training under 2 Maharashtra Engineer Regiment National Cadet Corps (NCC), IIT Bombay in 2019-20. 

In addition to multiple theoretical lessons about map reading, planning and different types of weaponry, we had a large number of practical experiences as well. Climbing vertical and horizontal ropes, maintainign fitness, rifle shooting were just some of the prime examples. Most of these were conducted during the Annual Training Camp (ATC). At ATC, I also won Gold medals in single and doubles Badminton, Table Tennis and in Tug of War. I also came 4th overall in rifle shooting. 

In addition, I was privilieged enough to represented the Regiment of over 200 cadets, as a part of the Maharashtra Directorate in a conference with the Defence Minister Hon. Rajnath Singh, to launch the DGNCC app for NCC Cadets. I also participated in the Republic Day Parade.
