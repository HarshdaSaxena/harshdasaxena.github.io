Sports has always been a hige part of my life. I mostly enjoy playing Table Tennis, Badminton and Basketball, and watching Cricket and Football (Soccer). 

I was part of the Girls team for Softball in 2016. We went up to the State Level, which was held in Satara, Maharashtra. I was selected for Nationals as well, owing to my performace as a batter and a catcher.

At IITB, I am part of the Girls Basketball team as well
